## Front End Trivia App for React

If you do not have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed <br>
- `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` <br>

Then if you do not have yarn installed run: <br>
- `brew install yarn` <br>
If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used. <br>
- `brew install yarn --without-node` <br>

git clone then run: <br>
- `yarn install` to install all dependencies <br>

to start the app in a browser run: <br>
- `yarn start` <br>

Now you will need the back end Ruby API to be fully functional <br>
